    "The goal of this notebook is to build a routine that takes in an equation of state (or several) and produces mass/radius curves from the Tolmann-Oppenheiner-Volkov (TOV) equations. The TOV equations are two equations that relate the energy density ($\\epsilon$), pressure ($P$), and mass ($m$) of a neutron star. The first equation, shown below, is derived by solving the Einstein equations for a time-invariant, spherically symmetric metric\n",
